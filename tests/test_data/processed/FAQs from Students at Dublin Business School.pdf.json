If it's a minor\nailment that you can manage with over-the-counter medication, you might not\nneed immediate medical attention. However, if your condition is serious or\nworsening, seek medical help promptly.\nContact a Doctor or GP: If you need medical attention, you can call a local\ndoctor (General Practitioner or GP) to schedule an appointment. They can\nprovide advice, diagnose your condition, and recommend appropriate treatment.\nWhich Doctor or GP should I visit?\nDBS has partnered with Dame Street Medical, as our chosen student medical\ncentre should students require a doctor's appointment. As many students may\nrequire a GP whilst studying, we believe this partnership will be beneficial to\nstudents due to its close proximity to the DBS campus.\nDame Street Medical is now taking on new patients and registering is extremely\neasy. To register simply book an appointment to see one of their doctors.\nTo book an appointment:\nCall (01 6790754) or email damestreetmedicalcentre@gmail.com",
