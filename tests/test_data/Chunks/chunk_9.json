  "content": "Q: I want to change or deregister a module?\nA: Contact your Programme Coordinator by logging a ticket to change or deregister an elective module. Please note there is a strict two-week window at the start of each semester in which you can change your modules, it is subject to availability. After this two-week window has elapsed, it will not be possible to change your modules. This is valid for elective modules only: compulsory modules cannot be changed. You will be informed if your programme has any elective modules. Student cards for new students You will receive an email in your DBS email account notifying you when your student card is ready for collection. This can take up to two weeks after the beginning of your classes. You can go to classes normally without your student card if you still do not have it, and your attendance will be fixed by us until the date you got your student card. Moodle Moodle is our virtual learning environment, and is used for many tasks during your studies. Here you will find access to your course material along with access or links to online, live or recorded classes. Your assessments will be uploaded through Moodle and feedback given there also. You will retain access to Moodle pages for the current academic year plus 1 year, with the exception of graduates, who lose access after 4 months. MS Office Learners will have access to MS Office, including their DBS email, until the 31st December of the year they graduate. Please note this access cannot be reinstated. Letter Requests Letters can be downloaded from the Self Service area on your Student Dashboard. The letter will be emailed to your DBS account instantly. These letters are tailored for opening a bank account, for a PPSN appointment, and to confirm your enrollment in DBS.",
